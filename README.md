The aim was to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. It is a form of generalized feed forward network that has internal memory which can be used to process the input data. Along with the RNN , a convolution neural network (CNN) is also used. A convolutional neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. In any feed-forward neural network, middle layers are called hidden because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. In a convolutional neural network, the hidden layers include layers that perform convolutions. Typically this includes a layer that does multiplication or other dot product, and its activation function is commonly ReLU. This is followed by other layers such as pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers. In this assignment, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed and trained on S&P 500 data. The model is tested by predicting the next one,two,three or four values using a sliding sampling window of 180 days. The models are also re-tested on noise-corrupted data to observe the performance. The goal of this project is to optimize the RNN to give the best possible results.
